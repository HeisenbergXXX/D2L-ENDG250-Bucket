Grade Bucket

This Mini web app is to apply "Bucket Scheme" to Solidworks test. 
Based on the traditional tolerence method, students will ether get a full mark on a question if it's anwser falls within the given tolerence(1%) or zero. This app is to determin a mark based on how far off the anwser is.
